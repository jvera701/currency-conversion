# currency-conversion

To run the project, please install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

And then run it in development mode

```sh
npm run dev
```

Note: due to API limitations shown [here](https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/set-base-currency) the base currency can only be USD for a free account. That's why the front only has USD as a base currency
